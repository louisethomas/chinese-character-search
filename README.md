# Chinese Character Search

The idea behind this project was to assist with learning new Chinese characters.

The *search_char.py* function accepts either Chinese words or characters.

If a word is passed to the funtion, it will return the pinyin and English definition, as well as the definitions of each character that makes up the word.

If a single character is passed to the function, it will return the pinyin and English definition, as well as the definition of each of the components and their compounds. The function will also return common compounds of the inputted character.
